                <h2>Wanderess-ish</h2>
                <p>"No boundaries,""contained by no countries," and my favorite "tamed by no time." Whew! That's what freedom sounds like. Thats the life I'm after. Since I was a child, I've always imagined myself traveling the world to see the work of God's hand.  Now in my 30's that desire has not been met but I'm so much closer to it becoming real. Have I traveled? Yes I have been to a few places that I'll talk about here but in my dreams, by this age, I would have atleast have experienced traveling outside of the country.  I'm sad to say that yet to happen, but nonetheless, it can and it will. So that is why this section is called wanderess-ish. I woudn't consider myself a wanderess now but soon I will be!</p>

                <p>I never realized how many places I've traveled to until I created this list.  I am proud of where I've been but there are so many other places I want to visit and more often.</p> 
                <h4>My Favs</h4>
                <p>The best place I traveled to was Gulf Shores, AL and California. Gulf Shores was like a new world to me.  I just loved the whole look of the town.  The hotel beaches, the short distance of the beach from everything, the fresh seafood, and so much more.  Loved that place. I loved California because I've been wanting to go there FOREVER.  I got to go to Disney Land and Universal Studies. Disney land was just like in the commercials. Just a very magical place. I was in shock when I got there because I've always dreamed of going and never knew when and if it would happen. I saw the castle that is their trademark that's in all the movies and it was wonderful. Even got to see the mindblowing fireworks show and parade. I was in tears because I was just so happy.  One day on one of my Wanderlust trips I will bring my nephews there so they can experience the same feelings.   Didn't really ride any rides there. I'm not a roller coaster type of gal(Heights or not my friend). I really liked Universal Studios because they had all these 3D rides! It was the best! I got to get on a roller coaster without really getting on a rollar coaster. My type of ride! Went to Hollywood and walked down several famous streets.  Ate some famous Cali food like In and Out burger and Pink's Hotdogs.  Saw the Hollywood sign and the Observatory. Enjoyed the mansion we rented and the beautiful weather.  Well, for the most part the weather was beautiful where our house was located but Malibu wasn't too kind to us with the weather.  I have never in my life been so uncomfortable at a beach. It was FREEZING. The residents were enjoying it but us tourist did not like it.  Worst trip to a beach ever and I absolutely ADORE beaches.  I wanted to visit the apartcomplex Issa lives in on her show Insecure but my boyfriend wanted to stay in the house more than explore because of his family not wanting to go anywhere. He even had his own rental! I can go on about that.  I was not happy about that BUT that is another story for another time. One day I will buy a house near a beach or visit a city with a beach monthly. I just love them. Miami is a great place as well! I just love the energy of the city and that there is water all over the place.  I've been to Miami twice and both times I didn't want to leave (Even when our flight got cancelled because of a Hurricane Warning). We had a penthouse on the beach. It was awesome. Notice how everyone of my favorite places includes a beach.  </p>

            <h4>My NOT SO Favs</h4>
                <p>By far Denver was THE WORST. We went in the middle of January. They had a blizzard on our way there. We drove 14 hrs! It was the worst. I can not stand snow! Let alone drive in it.  No other trip can compare to how I disliked this trip.  I went to sing with a group at a prayer event and that was fun but the city is not a place I have to visit again. The mountains were beautiful but the snow just ruined it all for me.  Sorry Denver. Maybe I'll give you another change. Maybe.</p>
